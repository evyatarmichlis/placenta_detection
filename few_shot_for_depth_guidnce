How to Implement This

Pre-training with XMS: Train your XMSNet model with its Cross-Modal Self-Supervision (XMS)
 for your 3D vision tasks using the full scale of your large dataset.

Focus on Metric Learning: During pre-training, integrate either:

Pure metric learning loss: Use Contrastive Loss or Triplet Loss to enforce strong embedding
 generation without explicit class labels.
Hybrid approach: Modify the XMS component to include some
class awareness along with the self-supervision. Augment with classification loss.
Few-Shot Adaptation:  When facing a new few-shot segmentation task:

Create a support set: Have a few labeled examples (1-5) for each new class.
Compute embeddings: Generate embeddings for the support set and any unseen
 image (query set) using XMSNet.
Segmentation via similarity: Assign pixels in the unseen image
labels based on their closest embeddings from the support set.
Considerations

Dataset Alignment: Ideally, the large dataset you train with should be
similar in domain to the types of few-shot tasks you expect to face in the future.
Regularization: Even with a large dataset,
 adding regularization techniques during pre-training
 can further reduce the risk of overfitting to the few-shot case
